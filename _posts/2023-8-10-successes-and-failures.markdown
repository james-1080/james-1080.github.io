# Successes and Failures
This semester was a little hard and undergone a cochlear implant surgery in the left ear. Am now hearing about over 90%
in speech with both working ears finally. Experiencing less hearing fatigue, improved morale, and overall quality of
life has been improved tremendously. Before the cochlear implant, I had two ears with hearing aids. I used to say what
or huh? Often enough I was struggling to hear and it was chaos with hearing aids because of deaf I was (profoundly
deaf at the very end of the spectrum). Now I can hear people with background noises. My overall language in English has
been enhancing ever since these implantations. Now I know what sounds I've missed and what they sound like and am
impressed to hear new sounds when I pronounce sounds I've never heard before thanks to 10+ years of speech therapy
and a few years of auditory verbal therapy as a young child. You can say I was language deprived for most of my life up
until recently. I still wouldn't change a thing because this is who I became. I am now learning other oral languages
which are Spanish, Swedish, Japanese, Chinese, and Russian. And still practicing American Sign Language. I am in the
third week of practicing all my languages. Oh and recently I received an AA in Language & Rationality degree with
honors. I guess I am doing fairly well in improving myself. I just picked up on the Communication Study AAT degree.
Looking forward to raking up degrees and certifications. If you can't tell I have a passion for education and strive
for excellence and go above and beyond that. Other than that I just turned in my project with my team to my computer
science final project. There was a learning curve in time management, and dealing with neglecting communications within
my team. This project was about making a website that is blind-friendly and allowed screen readers to pick up on menu items
and main ingredients in the food. We were unable to get the Tesseract OCR on the upload page working and finished on
time. We had a teammate who neglected our agreement for the allotted time on our contract I made that we all signed it
with the signature and time. Thankfully the contract is there for a reason nevertheless it was not an easy choice to exile
them out of our team. Be careful who you add to your team they may either help or hinder you. I am getting ready for
the fall semester classes, returning to the ASL Club as president. Taking ASL 3, Calculus 2, and 3 Communication classes
Worth about 17 units for 16 weeks I am crunching it. Anyway, that's all for now got to get to rest.
