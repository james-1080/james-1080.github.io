# Successes and Failures
This semester was a little hard, and undergone a cochlear implant surgery in the left ear. I am now hearing about over 90%
in speech with both working ears, finally. Experiencing less hearing fatigue, improved morale, and overall quality of
life has been improved tremendously. Before the cochlear implant, I had two ears with hearing aids. I used to say what
or huh? Often enough, I was struggling to hear, and it was chaos with hearing aids because of deaf I was (profoundly
deaf at the very end of the spectrum). Now, I can hear people with background noises. My overall language in English has
been enhancing ever since these implantations. Now I know what sounds I've missed and what they sound like, and I am
impressed to hear new sounds when I pronounce sounds I've never heard before, thanks to 10+ years of speech therapy
and a few years of auditory verbal therapy as a young child. You can say I was language-deprived for most of my life up
until recently. I still wouldn't change a thing because this is who I became. I am now learning other oral languages
: Spanish, German, Swedish, Japanese, Chinese, and Navajo. And still practicing American Sign Language. I am in the
third week of practicing all my languages. Oh, and recently, I received an AA in Language & Rationality degree with
honors. I am doing fairly well in improving myself. I just picked up on the Communication Study AAT degree.
I am looking forward to raking up degrees and certifications. If you can't tell, I have a passion for education, strive
for excellence, and go above and beyond that. Besides that, I just turned in my project with my team to my computer
science final project. There was a learning curve in time management and dealing with neglecting communications within
my team. This project was about making a blind-friendly website that allowed screen readers to pick up on menu items
and the main ingredients in the food. We could not get the Tesseract OCR on the upload page working and finished on
time. Our teammate neglected our agreement for the allotted time on our contract. I made sure that we all signed it
with the signature and time. Thankfully, the contract is there for a reason; exiling them from our team was difficult.
You must be careful who you add to your team. They may either help or hinder you. I am preparing for the fall semester
classes and returning to the ASL Club as president. I am taking ASL 3, Calculus 2, and 3 Communication classes. They are
worth about 17 units for 16 weeks, and I am crunching it. Anyway, that's all for now. I've got to get to rest.
