Hello everyone! I am a big-time computer geek who loves learning new things with computers. Here is what is about me... I love learning, which is one of my biggest passions in life. I am in my 30s pursuing one primary major, you've guessed it: Computer Science.

Although I have several other degrees, Language & Rationalities (LR), Communication Studies (CS), and Computer Electronics (CE), I'll share my background history on computers. I was intrigued by computers when I was 5, which was in 1995 (yes, I was born in 1990).

I started playing with it around 6/7 years old and played DOOM on a Windows 95. As I got older, around 10/11, I started gathering money from my lawn care business, mowing people's lawns and taking care of their yards. As I saved enough money, I built my first computer from scratch with little help.

I got even more curious and stumbled upon Linux. I did not understand how to manipulate Linux at the early ages of its development, and the first distro was SUSE.

Anyway, that is a little bit of my history. I am certified in PC with Windows, Unix/Unix-like OS Administration, Network Technician, and Programmer Specialist these days. My interests are learning OS kernels and embedded systems and understanding networking devices.
