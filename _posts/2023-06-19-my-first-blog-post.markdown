Hello everyone! I am a big-time computer geek who loves learning new things with computers. Here is what is about me... I love learning and it is one of my biggest passions in life. I am in my 30's pursuing one main major you've guessed it: Computer Science.

Although I have a couple of other degrees, Language & Rationalities (LR) and Computer Electronics (CE). I'll share my background history on computers. I was intrigued by computers by the time I was 5 and this was in 1995 (yes, I'm born in 1990).

I started playing with it around 6/7 years old and played DOOM on a Windows 95. As I got older around 10/11, I started gathering money from my lawn care business mowing people's lawns and taking care of their yards. As I saved enough money, I built my very first computer from scratch with little help.

I got even more curious and stumbled upon Linux. Did not really understand how to manipulate Linux when it was at the very early ages of its development and the first distro was SUSE.

Anyway, that is a little bit of my history. These days I am certified in PC with Windows, certified Unix/Unix-like OS Administration, certified Network Technician, and certified Programmer Specialist. My interests are learning OS kernels, embedded systems, and understanding networking devices.
