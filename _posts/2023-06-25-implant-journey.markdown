# Implant Journey
---
### Let's rewind the tape
---
I was born deaf, and I have five active deaf genes with two hearing parents. When I was around 2-3, this was when my parents found out I was deaf. There wasn't a law that checked babies to see if they were deaf. Anyway, I wore hearing aids at the start and was denied cochlear implants even though I was profoundly deaf. I struggled with hearing aids almost my whole life until I got cochlear implants. My language was poor, language deprived, and I had language delays; it was due to the fact I had holes in my hearing. I still managed to communicate with people when I could understand them. Still, half of it was me filling in the communication gaps, most of which was deciphering and guesswork. Some of that created issues for me with people and communication. A year ago, I was implanted for the first time around May and activated a month later on June 20th, 2022. I was able to hear things but could not comprehend the speeches well. A few months went by, and I was gaining 60% speech discrimination on the implant side with background noise (health providers will do one ear at a time). It was groundbreaking; I did not have that good of speech discrimination when I was on hearing aids. About a year later, I got implanted in the second ear and activated around the same time. I could comprehend the sounds in the second activation, while some people sounded like they were huffing on helium tanks while talking to me; however, I could understand speech quickly this time. This is major in my point of life. I will at least be able to understand people and hear sounds I have never heard. Now, I can ease myself a little bit by communicating with people.

I look forward to the journey with new ears and creating meaningful connections with people.
