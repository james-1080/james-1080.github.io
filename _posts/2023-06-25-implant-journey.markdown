# Implant Journey
---
### Let's rewind the tape
---
I was born deaf and I have five active deaf genes with two hearing parents. When I was around 2-3 this was when my parents found out I was deaf. There wasn't a law that checked babies if they were deaf or not. Anyway, I wore hearing aids at the start and was denied cochlear implants even though I was profoundly deaf.
I struggled with hearing aids almost my whole life until I got cochlear implants. My language was poor, language deprived, and I had language delays it was due to the fact I had holes in my hearing. I still managed to communicate with people when I could understand them but half of it was me filling in the communication
gaps and the majority of that was deciphering and guesswork. Some of that created issues for me with people and communication. A year ago I was implanted for the very first time around May and then was activated a month later on June 20th, 2022. I was able to hear things but could not comprehend the speeches well. A few
months went by I was gaining 60% speech discrimination on the implant side with background noise (health providers will do one ear at a time) it was groundbreaking I did not have that good of speech discrimination when I was on hearing aids. Now about a year later I got implanted in the second ear and activated around
the same time. I was able to comprehend the sounds in the second activation while some people sound like they were huffing on helium tanks while talking to me however I can understand speech quickly this time around. This is major in my point of life I will at least be able to understand people and hear sounds that
I have never heard before. Now I can ease myself a little bit with communication with people. I look forward to the journey with new ears and creating meaningful connections with people.
